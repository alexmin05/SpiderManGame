This is the final iteration of my CS-1 project. In this "game," Spider-Man fights two of his deadliest foes: the symbiotes Venom and Carnage. Across a beautiful city landscape, the three super-powered beings chase and flee each other, creating chaos. Each character's has its own unique movement and interactions with the other two. However, the game also contains two buildings with which the characters can interact. Depending on what character crashes into the bank or school, the bank or school will reflect a certain level of damage. For instance, Venom's collision will cause the buildings to be "nearly destroyed." As previously stated, Spider-Man and Carnage will have their own effect on the buildings.

All throughout this can't-miss action, the Spider-Man theme continously builds higher and higher, until reaching an ultimate crescendo five-or-so minutes into the game. Additionally, a "crash" sound effect will play when the characters hit the buildings.
