This is the final iteration of my CS-1 project. In this "game," Spider-Man fights two of his deadliest foes: the symbiotes Venom and Carnage. Across a beautiful city landscape, the three super-powered beings chase and flee each other, creating chaos. Each character possesses its own unique movement and interactions with the other two characters. But the fun doesn't stop there: the game also contains two buildings -- a bank and a school -- with which the characters can interact. Depending on what character crashes into the bank or school, the bank or school will reflect a certain level of damage. For instance, Venom's collision will cause the buildings to be "nearly destroyed." As previously stated, Spider-Man and Carnage will have their own effect on the buildings.

All throughout this can't-miss action, Spider-Man's iconic theme grows and builds higher and higher, ultimately reaching a stunning crescendo approx. five minutes into the game. Additionally, a "crash" sound effect will play when the characters hit the buildings.
